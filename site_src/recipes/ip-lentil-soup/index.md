* 1 tsp salt
* 1 Tbsp tomato paste

## Process
1. Set Instant Pot to "Saute." Heat the oil.
2. Saute onions, garlic, spices, tomato paste, carrots, celery (if using), and potatoes for 3-5 minutes, or until onions begin to soften.
3. Stir in the lentils to combine.
4. Add water and broth base, and mix well.
5. Close the lid, making sure the steam valve is turned to "Sealing." Set the Instant Pot to "Manual" and set the timer to 3 minutes. (It will take 10-20 minutes for it to come to pressure.)
6. Use the quick release method to release the pressure until it is safe to unlock the lid.
7. Stir in the kale, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
