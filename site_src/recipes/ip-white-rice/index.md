blurb      : Basic white rice cooked to perfection in the Instant Pot

## Ingredients
* 1 C white, basmati, or jasmine rice
* 1 C water
* &frac14; tsp salt

## Equipment
* Measuring cups and spoons
* Fine-mesh strainer
* Instant Pot

## Process
1. Measure the rice into a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water for 3 minutes or until the water runs clear.
2. Combine the rice, water, and salt in the Instant Pot.
3. Close the lid, making sure the steam valve is turned to "Sealing."
4. Set the Instant Pot to "Manual" and set the timer to 3 minutes. (It will take 5-10 minutes for it to come to pressure.)
5. When the cook time is up, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes. 
6. Quick release any remaining pressure. Uncover, fluff the rice with a fork, and serve immediately.
