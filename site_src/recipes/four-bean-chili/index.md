## Ingredients

* 1 medium sweet onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 Tbsp chili powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp oregano
* 1 tsp salt
* &frac12; tsp black pepper
* &frac12; C red kidney beans
* &frac12; C black beans
* &frac12; C pinto beans
* &frac12; C red lentils, rinsed
* &frac12; C TVP
* 2&frac12; - 3 C water
* 1 28-oz can crushed tomatoes (fire roasted, if available)

## Equipment

* Instant Pot
* Measuring cups and spoons
* Can opener
* Wooden spatula

## Process

1. Soak red kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans for at least 4 hours.
2. Set Instant Pot to saute. Add a tablespoon or so of water and heat until starting to steam. Add onion and stir frequently. Saute until translucent, about 5 minutes, adding more water to keep onions from sticking.
3. Add garlic and saute for 30-60 seconds more, until aromatic.
4. Add spices, salt, and pepper and stir until very well combined.
5. Drain & rinse the beans and add to the pot along with the red lentils, TVP, water, and crushed tomatoes.
6. Set the Instant Pot to "Manual" and set the timer to 60 minutes. Close the lid, making sure the steam valve is turned to "Sealing."
7. Once the time is up, allow the pot to release pressure naturally. Once the pressure pin has dropped, turn off the Instant Pot (using the "Cancel" button), remove the lid, and allow the chili to sit for 10-15 minutes, allowing it to cool as well as letting the flavors to marry.
8. Stir before serving.
