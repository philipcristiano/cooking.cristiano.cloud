# Welcome!

The Cristiano clan is two adults and one toddler doing our best to live sustainably in Philadelphia, PA. We compost our food scraps, grow a small percentage of our produce in a vertical hydroponic garden, participate in the local Buy Nothing group, use alternative transportation to get around, and practice a vegan lifestyle.

This is our family recipe book, chronicling the plant-based recipes we make on a regular basis, including pantry staples and everyday meals.
